# Do your lessons have captions?

Yes, it does! Our system has native built-in captions for our lessons. Captions can be controlled by the "CC" button located in the lower left of the lesson environment. If you encounter any lessons that do not have captions, please notify us.

Currently, captions are only available in English. We are working to develop multi-language caption support. We also don't have any transcripts for our lesson at this time.
