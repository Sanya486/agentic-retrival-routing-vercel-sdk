# How to I reset my progress?

To reset your progress for a course, right-click the course title, open the context menu, and select "Reset Progress."

Please note that this process only resets your progress number; it does not delete your challenge submissions. To delete these as well, you will need to right-click the challenge icon and click "Reset Challenge," which will remove your submission. Currently, there is no bulk option to do this, so it will need to be done per lesson as you proceed.

Please note that these actions is irreversible.
