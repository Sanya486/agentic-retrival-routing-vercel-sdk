# Can I download the code in a scrim?

Certainly! Navigate to the project/lesson you'd like to download, hit the cog icon in the bottom right corner, and choose _**Download as Zip**_.

Please note that some Scrimba projects are bundled in a special way in order to make them run fully in the browser, which means you're not guaranteed that your project will run as might you expect it will do locally. This is usually the case with projects that use NPM modules, as they are usually not something you'd be able to run without Node JS. So in order to make it work in the browser, we've had to do some magic under the hood on Scrimba.com.
