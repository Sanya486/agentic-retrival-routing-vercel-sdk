# The editor is not working correctly

If your code won’t run or you encounter a **sync error, TypeError,** or other error message issues, follow these troubleshooting steps:

- **Double check your code**
  - Syntax errors, infinite loops, and other issues can cause unwanted behavior in our editor.

- **Use Incognito Mode**
  - Open our platform in a private/incognito window. Some browser extensions interfere with functionality, so this helps minimize issues.

- **Create a Dedicated Browser Profile**
  - Instead of uninstalling extensions, set up a separate user profile for Scrimba in your browser. [Learn how to do this in Chrome here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824): [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824)

- **Try a Different Browser**
  - Our platform works best on **Chromium-based browsers** (such as Chrome and Edge). While Safari and Firefox may work for some, they can cause compatibility issues.

- **Restart Your Browser**
  - Close all browser windows completely, then reopen and try again.

- **Clear Your Cache**
  - Cached files can sometimes cause errors. Clear your browser cache and refresh the page.

- **Restart Your Device**
  - A full device restart can resolve temporary system issues affecting your browser.

- **Test on Another Device or Network**
  - If possible, try accessing our platform from another device or a different internet network. In rare cases, network restrictions can cause errors.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, contact our support team at https://scrimba.com/help
